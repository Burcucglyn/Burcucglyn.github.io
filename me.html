                <p class="life-prose">
                    Born and raised in Bursa, Turkey, I graduated with a BEng in Environmental Engineering in 2019 from Kocaeli University and moved to the UK. I've been living in London for six years now. Despite everyone hating the pandemic, that's when I fell in love with the city it was empty, quiet, free of chaotic energy. It gave me space to discover London properly, and I loved it. Most of my time outside of work is spent moving in water, on walls, or in the gym. The rest splits between the kitchen, a book, or discovering neighbourhood spots and ranking their food in my own way!

                    <div class="life-item-label">Swimming</div>
                    <p>Learnt to swim around 4 or 5, swam competitively through high school, then stopped. Picked it up again four years ago and found the zen in the water. It's become my main reset mechanism, how I clear my head to deliver clean, unbreakable data pipelines. <span class="highlight">The pool is where I regulate myself.</span></p>

                <div class="life-item">
                    <div class="life-item-label">Bouldering</div>
                    <p> Every route is a puzzle, you read the wall, plan the sequence, and either the beta works or it doesn't. No ambiguity. A way to routine catch up with friends while solving problems together.</p>

                    <div class="life-item-label">Strength Training</div>
                    <p>Consistent routine. I love feeling powerful, testing movements, tuning how my body reacts. Not unlike optimizing hyperparameters in a model, honestly.</p>

                <div class="life-item">
                    <div class="life-item-label">Foodie</div>
                    <p>I cook based on what's in the fridge, can't follow recipes precisely because I lack the patience. That's my secret weapon, every meal tastes different. Same approach I take to eating out, finding the spot that does one thing properly, the unexpected neighbourhood place. That's a good day. London is unbeatable for this.</p>

                    <div class="life-item-label">Reading & Music</div>
                    <p>I read across topics, whatever pulls me in. The best books change how I think about things I thought I already understood. Music is always on, whether working, training, or cooking. It sets the pace. My taste is wide, I'm not precious about it.</p>

                <div class="life-item">

                    <p><span class="highlight">Travelling</span> ties most of this together. I've lived in enough places to know that the best way to understand somewhere is through the food, the landscape, and how people spend their time when they're not working. That's what I look for wherever I go. These aren't separate from the work, they're how I think. Problem-solving in water, on walls, in the kitchen, in books. Testing, iterating, finding what works. That's the same process I bring to data pipelines, model tuning, and predictions.</p>
