                <p class="life-prose">
                    Born and raised in Bursa, Turkey. Graduated with a BEng in Environmental Engineering from Kocaeli University in 2019 and moved to the UK. 
                    Six years in London now. Unpopular opinion: I fell in love with the city during the pandemic. 
                    Empty streets, no crowds, space to actually see things. It let me discover London properly, and I've stayed attached ever since.
                    Outside work, I'm usually in water, on climbing walls, or at the gym. 
                    The rest of my time goes to cooking, reading, or finding neighbourhood spots and mentally ranking their food.
                    I take the rankings seriously. And serious about collecting metrics.
                </p>

                    <div class="life-item-label">Swimming</div>
                    <p>Learnt to swim around 4 or 5, swam competitively through high school, then stopped.
                        Picked it up again four years ago and found the zen in the water. 
                        It's become my main reset mechanism, how I clear my head to deliver clean, unbreakable data pipelines. <span class="highlight">The pool is where I regulate myself.</span></p>

                <div class="life-item">
                    <div class="life-item-label">Bouldering</div>
                    <p> Every route is a puzzle, you read the wall, plan the sequence, and either the beta works or it doesn't. 
                        No ambiguity. A way to routine catch up with friends while solving problems together.</p>

                    <div class="life-item-label">Strength Training</div>
                    <p>Consistent routine. I love feeling powerful, testing movements, tuning how my body reacts. 
                        Not unlike optimizing hyperparameters in a model, honestly.</p>

                <div class="life-item">
                    <div class="life-item-label">Foodie</div>
                    <p>I cook based on what's in the fridge, can't follow recipes precisely because I lack the patience. 
                        That's my secret weapon, every meal tastes different. 
                        Same approach I take to eating out, finding the spot that does one thing properly, the unexpected neighbourhood place. That's a good day. London is unbeatable for this.</p>

                    <p>I read across topics, whatever pulls me in. The best books change how I think about things I thought I already understood. 
                        Music is always on, whether working, training, or cooking. 
                        It sets the pace. My taste is wide, I'm not precious about it.</p>

                    <p><span class="highlight">Travelling</span> ties most of this together. 
                        Luckly I've lived in enough places to know that the best way to understand somewhere is through the food, the landscape, and how people spend their time when they're not working.
                         That's what I look for wherever I go.</p>

                These aren't separate from the work, they're how I think. Problem-solving in water, on walls, in the kitchen, in books. Testing, iterating, finding what works. That's the same process I bring to data pipelines, model tuning, debugging what I missed and finally predictions.
