                    <p>
                        I started in environmental engineering, where I learned that real world data is messy by default and that the work before the analysis often determines whether the results mean anything. Three years in marketing taught me something different: <span class="highlight">how to translate numbers into decisions for people who care about outcomes, not methods.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The MSc in Data Science at Birkbeck brought the technical depth. My dissertation trained 556 machine learning models across London's air quality monitoring networks. The finding I'm most proud of is a simple one: the previous hour's reading explains almost everything. Sometimes the honest answer is that the problem is simpler than it looks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I want next is work where I build reliable prediction systems and translate complex data into something any audience can act on. Environmental engineering gives me domain context for climate and sustainability work. Marketing gave me the ability to communicate with stakeholders who aren't technical. The MSc gave me the modelling skills. The approach applies wherever messy data meets real decisions: climate risk, health analytics, campaign optimisation, or operational forecasting.
